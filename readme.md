**Task Manager** is an advanced project that helps users **create, update, delete, and manage tasks efficiently**. It can be used for personal productivity, team collaboration, or project management. Letâ€™s break it down:

### **Core Features:**
1. **User Authentication** â€“ Allow users to **sign up, log in**, and access their own tasks securely.
2. **Task CRUD Operations** â€“ Users can **Create, Read, Update, and Delete** tasks.
3. **Deadline & Priority System** â€“ Set **due dates** and **priority levels** for tasks.
4. **Database Storage** â€“ Store tasks in **MongoDB, MySQL, or Firebase** for persistent data.
5. **Task Filtering & Search** â€“ Users can filter tasks **by category, priority, or deadline**.
6. **Collaboration** â€“ Multiple users can assign tasks to each other **(optional feature)**.
7. **Dark Mode & UI Enhancements** â€“ Improve user experience with a sleek UI.

### **Tech Stack Choices:**
âœ… **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React for dynamic UI)\
âœ… **Backend:** Node.js with Express (or Python Flask)\
âœ… **Database:** MongoDB (NoSQL) or MySQL (SQL)\
âœ… **Authentication:** Firebase Auth or JWT (JSON Web Token)\
âœ… **Hosting:** Deploy on **Netlify, Vercel, or Heroku**.

### **How the Task Manager Works:**
1. **User signs in** and sees their **dashboard**.
2. **They add tasks** with a title, description, due date, and priority.
3. **Tasks appear in a structured list** (sortable by priority, deadline, etc.).
4. **Users can edit or delete tasks** as needed.
5. **Data is stored in a database** to persist even after logout.

### **Example Code Snippet (Adding a Task in Node.js with MongoDB)**
```js
const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/taskDB");

const taskSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    title: String,
    description: String,
    deadline: Date,
    priority: String
});

const Task = mongoose.model("Task", taskSchema);

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post("/addTask", async (req, res) => {
    const newTask = new Task(req.body);
    await newTask.save();
    res.send("Task added successfully!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running on port 3000"));
```
